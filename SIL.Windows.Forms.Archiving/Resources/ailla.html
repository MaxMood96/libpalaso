				<td>Users have full access to these materials after agreeing to our Terms and Conditions and logging in. Choose this level for all non-sensitive materials. This is the default level.</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="nowrap">Level 2: Password</td>
				<td>-</td>
				<td>You define a password with an optional hint. You can provide access to others by sharing the password with them. Passwords with hints allow a set of people to share resources easily. Hints can be something like that everyone in your in-group knows, but no outsider would know. Example: password = 7awin7; hint = 'zoque amigo'. You can use one password + hint for one set of resources and another for a different set. This is the most flexible option.</td>

				<td class="nowrap">Level 3: Time Limit</td>
				<td>-</td>
				<td>After the date specified, access will change to Level 1. Example: 2050-01-01 (January 1, 2050.) This option is good for resources that are only sensitive for a period of time; for example, the lifetime of the narrator or the five years until you finish your thesis. You will still be able to access these materials yourself with the password.</td>

				<td class="nowrap">Level 4: Depositor control</td>
				<td>-</td>
				<td>Users must contact you directly to ask you for the password. AILLA will provide contact information. Note that you must maintain your contact information and be prepared to respond to requests from people you do not know.</td>
